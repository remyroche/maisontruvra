          <div class="text-lg text-brand-dark-gray space-y-6 leading-relaxed">
            <p>For over a decade, a world of cultures, yeasts, and the patient magic of fermentation taught me that the most complex flavors arise from the simplest elements, manipulated with scientific precision and profound respect. My love for cooking was never just about recipes; it was about understanding an ingredient at its most fundamental level.</p>
            <p>This obsession with process is the foundation of Maison Trüvra.</p>

          <div class="text-lg text-brand-dark-gray space-y-6 leading-relaxed">
            <p>The truffle is an icon of luxury, yet it is an ingredient of frustrating inconsistency. Its flavor, a complex tapestry of earth, musk, and unmistakable umami, is a fleeting gift of nature. For every perfect specimen, countless others are underwhelming. As a chef and a scientist, I could not accept this lottery.</p>
            <p>I knew that to truly honor the truffle, I had to control its destiny.</p>

          <div class="text-lg text-brand-dark-gray space-y-6 leading-relaxed">
            <p>The solution was not to tame nature, but to create a world where it could achieve its ultimate potential. Our proprietary hydroponic biosphere is that world. It is a closed-loop ecosystem where we provide purest water, organic nutrients, and the precise conditions that our truffles crave.</p>
            <p>This method respects nature by eliminating its unpredictability. It uses less water than traditional agriculture, requires no soil disruption, and ensures that every single truffle is a perfect expression of its species. It is the fusion of ecological responsibility and uncompromising quality.</p>
