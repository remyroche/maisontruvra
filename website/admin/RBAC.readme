Guide to Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

You now have a flexible and secure system for managing staff access. Here's how it works and how to use it.
How it Works

    Permissions: We've defined a list of specific actions a user can take, like VIEW_USERS or MANAGE_PRODUCTS. These are the building blocks of your access control.

    Roles: Roles (e.g., "Marketing Manager", "Content Editor") are simply collections of these permissions.

    Users: You assign one or more roles to each staff member. A user's total access is the sum of all permissions from all their assigned roles.

    The "Admin" Role: The role named "Admin" is special. It has unrestricted access to everything and bypasses all permission checks. This role cannot be edited from the UI.

How to Manage Roles and Permissions

    Log in to your admin panel.

    Navigate to the new "Roles & Permissions" page using the link in the header.

    You will see a table with permissions listed as rows and your staff roles as columns.

    To grant a role a specific permission, simply check the corresponding box. To revoke it, uncheck the box.

    You can use the "Select All in Group" checkbox at the top of each permission category to grant or revoke all permissions in that category for a role in one click.

    Once you've made your changes, click the "Save Changes" button at the top right.
